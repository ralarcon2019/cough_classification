    <h3>What Is VOCOVID?</h3>
    <p>
      By providing results based on a convolutional neural network trained on a
      dataset labeled by licensed doctors, VOCOVID is equipped to inform users
      when they are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms as opposed to another illness.

      If you continue to upload recordings daily, VOCOVID will map out the progression
      of your illness and even predict when you may experience new symptoms or recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reporting associated symptoms such as high fever, runny nose, or body aches
      can further help you decide when to seek urgent medical attention.
